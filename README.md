# Glowing Ores

Making ores emit light

I don't plan on supporting or publishing this simple mod, it's my first mod in fabric or second, and I'm doing this just for fun

Based on [Glore](https://github.com/Apothicon02/Glowing-Ores/tree/fabric) with a few improvements:

1. Now it's client side mod
2. [Fix bug](https://github.com/Apothicon02/Glowing-Ores/pull/2)
3. Update dependencies

It has one more feature which is config screen, but it's quite broken
